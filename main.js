// AKA a LAMBDA (an anonymous function that doesn't get named)
// but is usually used as a value passed to another function
// in order to pass a behavior as a value.
// "action" is the LAMBDA b/c w/ the () you're saying it's going to be a function.

// Scope = context in which a variable can be accessed (in function or global).
// Each function acts like its own individual universe
// and the variables that are created within that universe don't interact
// with the variables created in another universe or another function.

// ALWAYS use the VAR keyword when creating a variable inside a function.
// If you donâ€™t, your function is reaching out to the global scope
// and might override another variable with the same name.
// // As long as you use the var keyword to create the variable,
// you can use the same variable inside functions,
// and the variable will only exist inside that function.
// GLOBAL SCOPE = when a variable is accessible anywhere inside a program
